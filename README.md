To-Do List with a unique twist: users must take a photo to mark a task as completed. Each task can be set as private or public.

Private tasks are only visible to the user.
Public tasks can be seen by friends.
There is a social feed where users can view completed tasks from their friends, along with a count of how many were set as public.
The app uses Firebase Firestore (Realtime Database) for storing tasks, user data, and task visibility settings.
